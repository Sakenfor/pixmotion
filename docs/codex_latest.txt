• There is a lot here! I’m mapping out how to let users drag nodes around while storing their positions in the graph layout so node placement persists. This involves making nodes movable with QGraphicsItem flags, tracking position
  changes to update the graph’s layout dictionary, and adjusting rendering to load saved positions or arrange unplaced nodes nicely. I’ll also add UI to manage multiple anchor slots and custom variables per node via metadata editors,
  ensuring these sync cleanly with node data. To support user requests for adding nodes by dragging—like Blender—I’m considering context menus, drag-and-drop from a node palette, or special add-node modes, but may start with simple
  context menu placement for now. Finally, I plan to update edge positioning dynamically as nodes move, keeping the graph visually consistent. This is a big but manageable set of enhancements, and I’ll approach implementation step-by-
  step, updating relevant classes to pass panel references and track changes. Let’s explore these improvements carefully!

  Planning node creation via drag-and-drop palette

  I’m considering adding a draggable node palette listing node types to let users drag new nodes onto the canvas, matching their expectation for “dragging with cursor” creation. This would involve enabling drag on QListWidget items
  and handling drop logic in the graph panel, possibly integrating with the existing UI structure like toolbars or side panels. Given time constraints, I may start with this simplified approach while also supporting context-menu node
  addition for flexibility. Let’s see how to blend these ideas smoothly!


• I'm adjusting the item to accept a panel parameter and setting flags so it’s movable and sends geometry changes. I’m adding an itemChange override to respond to position changes by updating the panel’s edges and layout accordingly.
  I’ll make sure anchor handles refresh when metadata updates and verify that setting position uses the correct scene coordinates to keep nodes properly aligned in the layout.


• I’m rewriting the node layout method to respect stored positions, placing missing nodes around a circle centered on existing nodes or origin. I’ll update the graph layout dictionary accordingly and compute scene rect with padding.
  I’m also adding methods to handle node moves, update connected edges, and refresh the scene rect dynamically. Next, I’ll ensure these integrate into rendering and imports are correct.




• I’m planning several new methods to handle refreshing the scene rectangle, updating edge geometry, and responding to node movement, placing them near related functions for clarity. I'll update imports to include QRectF from PyQt6,
  and integrate movement tracking in the _GraphNodeItem class by adding a panel reference and overriding itemChange to notify the panel on position changes. I'll carefully structure _layout_nodes to compute and store node positions,
  update the scene rectangle accordingly, and ensure edge updates are managed consistently. This setup should improve the graph’s interactive layout and rendering behavior.
